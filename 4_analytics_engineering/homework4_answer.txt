Question 1: Understanding dbt model resolution

Answer: select * from myproject.my_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi

The env variables values myproject and my_nyc_tripdata take precedence over dtc_zoomcamp_20205 and raw_nyc_tripdata because env variables defined using env_var macro and their default values have the lowest precedence.

Question 2: dbt Variables & Dynamic Models

Answer: Update the WHERE clause to pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30")) }}' DAY

The variable days_back would depend on the DAYS_BACK env variable which by default is set to 30. DAYS_BACK could then be overridden by supplying a command line argument for days_back.

Question 3: dbt Data Lineage and Execution

Answer: dbt run --select models/staging/+

This would only run the models inside the staging folder, fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue is not included because it is in the core folder.



Question 4: dbt Macros and Jinja

Answer:
	• Setting a value for DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile
	• When using core, it materializes in the dataset defined in DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET
	• When using stg, it materializes in the dataset defined in DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET, or defaults to DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET
	• When using staging, it materializes in the dataset defined in DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET, or defaults to DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET
